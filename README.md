The perfect companion mod to Sk1er's Old Animations Mod! We've added necessary features to amplify the 1.7 experience perpetuated by Sk1er's amazing mod.

This mod requires Sk1er's Old Animations Mod to also be present in your mods folder! Your game WILL crash if Sk1er's OAM isn't found.

# Features

  **2D Items** - Make items rotate towards the player, simulating a 2D effect.
 
 **1.7 Item Switching** - Make item switching activate only if the inventory slot has changed. This feature is a fix to the feature of the same name in Sk1er's mod.
 
 **1.7 Projectiles** - Make projectiles have the correct rotation, fixing mirrored projectiles on 1.8.

  **Cleaner Enchantment Glint** - Make the enchantment glint only display up to down. 

  **1.15+ Armor Enchantment Glint** - Make the armor enchantment glint like the 1.15 animation.

  **1.7 Third Person Blockhit Rendering** - Render the third person blockhit like in 1.7.

  **Spiderfrog Old Animations Punching** - Enable 1.7 item usage whilst punching like Spiderfrog's Old Animations. Fixes false anti-cheat detections.

  **1.7 Mixces Item / Block Positions** - Uses the 1.7 item positions for all items and blocks in both the first and third person POV.

  **1.7 Mixces First Person Carpet Position** - Lowers the carpets in the first person POV similar to how it's done in 1.7.
